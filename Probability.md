### Car Crashes
*Easy
**Q:** On a given busy intersection, the probability of at least one car crash in a 1 hour time interval is \frac{8}{9}. Assuming that car crashes occur independently of one another and at a constant rate throughout time, find the probability of at least one car crash in a 30 minute interval.

**A:** Let the probability in question be $p$. We know that the probability there is no car crash in the hour interval is \frac{1}{9} by complementation.
